<h2>What is Microsoft Active Directory?</h2>
Active Directory is a software for Windows domain networks, designed, built and maintained by Microsoft that allows for the creation and central management of thousands of user accounts from a single location. Active Directory is a database for creating and storing information in a hierarchical structure. It is easily accessible by both admin users and non-admin users. It is an encompassing system of various directory-based identity-related services. A Domain Controller (DC), the server that runs the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), is contacted whenever a user logs into a device or accesses another device across the network. The DC authenticates users, stores user information and enforces the security policy in a directory/domain.
